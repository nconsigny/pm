## About All Core Devs - Testing

The All Core Devs - Testing (ACDT) meetings are focused on testing infrastructure, tools, and methodologies used by Ethereum developers. These calls bring together testing experts, client developers, and other contributors working on improving Ethereum's testing ecosystem.

Topics typically covered include:

- Test suites and frameworks
- Testing methodologies and best practices
- Testing coordination across client implementations
- Devnets, testnets, and shadow forks
- Regression testing
- Fuzz testing and property-based testing
- Performance and benchmarking
- Continuous integration and automated testing
- Testing new protocol features before deployment
